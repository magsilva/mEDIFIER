# mEDIFIER

[中文](./README_zh_CN.md)  
An open-source alternative to the Edifier Connect app  
I just don't know why the Edifier Connect takes up more than 200MB on my phone.  

# Pros
+ Smaller  
  (Android: ~9MB, PC: ~30MB)  
+ No Internet is required  
+ Less click on the physical buttons  
+ Cross-platform  
+ Switch connection between Bluetooth hosts(Android only)  
+ Export settings to file
+ Restore settings from file

# Cons
+ Tested on W820NB, W820NB Double Gold and W200BT Plus only  
  (Maybe works for W820NB Plus and W820NB somehow)  
+ The BLE connection on Windows hardly works  
+ Sending raw commands to your device might break it
